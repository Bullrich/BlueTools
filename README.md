# Blue Tools

### This is a recopilation of tools for several unity projects

Be aware that this isn't a project, but a folder, import this **inside** a unity project.

Half of them I learned them from school, watching a guide or reading a book, I optimized them for my needs.

The tools here are mostly AI.
